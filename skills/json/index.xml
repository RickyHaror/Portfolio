      <description>I automated the task of manually validating thousands of links in the Brightspace LMS.
Online courses housed in a secure LMS can have hundreds of hyperlinks on HTML pages that point to public websites as means of additional content or supplemental resources for students. Validating those hyperlinks across hundreds of courses, several times year, is a very manual time-consuming process. Hyperlinks break often and this is becoming a growing problem as the number of open learning resources available publicly on the web grows.</description>

      <description>I automated content updates to online course with my Content Library App.
Based on my experience of working on several development teams, online courses typically have some content that is the same across all courses. An example of this might be a &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; module. When there are a few hundred courses and a change needs to be made to this module, updating that content can be tedious and time-consuming.</description>
